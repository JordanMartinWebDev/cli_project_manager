# CLI Project Manager
A bare bones Project Management Solution
## Features
- Able to create/delete projects
- Able to assign tasks to projects
- Able to create/delete tasks from projects
## Install
This project, being a cli, does not currently have an executable. To run, clone the repo, run npm install, then npm start. I've included a blank JSON object file in the repo, as that's where the data will be stored to when you hit save.
